To forward frames from ingress port to egress port, a VLAN10 is created with two ports: Port1: TAG aware. UN-TAGGED frames are classified to port default VID. Tagged frames are classified to TAG VID Port2: TAG aware. Frames are transmitted with classified VID as TAG VID value. To exemplify the decoding and encoding, Port1 is considered the ingress port and Port2 is the egress port. The interface (port) names '1' and '2' must have 'port-type' as 'c-vlan-bridge-port' meaning C-TAG aware.

Access Control List Advanced frame processing can be set up using the Access Control List (ACL) of the switch. Each rule in the list is called an Access Control Entry (ACE). For each frame received on an ingress port, the ACL is searched until an ACE matching the ingress port and frame properties is found. The action of the first matching ACE determines the forwarding of the frame. If no matching ACE is found, the default action (section 'Port ACL default actions') of the ingress port is used. By default, the ACL is empty and the default port actions allow forwarding of frames. An ACE is divided into two parts - the matching key and the action. The matching key has some common parameters and some parameters that are related to the frame type selected. The action parameters are common, independent of the selected frame type. Some parameters xxx have a related xxx-mask parameter. In this xxx-mask, any bit position with a '0' is matched as a 'don’t-care', meaning both '0' and '1' in this position generate a match. All parameters for an ACE can be found described in the mchp-velocitysp-acl.yang file.

The Filtering Database is also called the Forwarding Database or MAC Address Table. It helps direct network frames to their intended destination. The database has these basic functions: Dynamic entries: When a frame ingresses on a port, the port, the classified VLAN, and the source MAC address are saved in the database - this is called a dynamic entry. Over time, the switch builds a table mapping MAC addresses to specific ports in specific VLANs. Static entries: In the database, entries can be saved by management, this is called a static entry. Forwarding: When a frame ingresses on a port in a classified VLAN, the switch looks in the database to find the destination MAC address in this VLAN. If found, the switch forwards the frame to the corresponding port. Flooding: If the destination MAC address in the VLAN is not found in the table, the switch will send the frame to all ports except the one on which it was received. Aging of dynamic entries: If a dynamic entry source MAC address is not seen on the learned port for a certain period (age-time), then it is removed from the database. Flush: The database can be flushed by management, meaning the dynamic entries are deleted and the learning process is restarted. Filtering: The switch uses the MAC address table to filter traffic. Frames are only forwarded to the necessary ports. For example, if an ingress frame has a destination MAC address that is learned on the ingress port, it is not forwarded. Static entries are added to the FDB by management and are never removed by aging. Static entries can have multiple destination ports, meaning that the frame matching the entry is forwarded to all those ports. Static entries can be deleted by management. The entry has only one destination port. iPATCH request message: - ? \"/ieee802-dot1q-bridge:bridges/bridge[name='b0']/component[name='c0']/\\ filtering-database/filtering-entry\" : database-id: 0 address: 00-00-00-00-00-01 vids: '10' entry-type: static port-map: - port-ref: 2 The entry has multiple destination ports. iPATCH request message: - ? \"/ieee802-dot1q-bridge:bridges/bridge[name='b0']/component[name='c0']/\\ filtering-database/filtering-entry\" : database-id: 0 address: 01-00-00-00-00-01 vids: '10' entry-type: static port-map: - port-ref: 2 - port-ref: 3 Dynamic entries are added due to frames ingressing on a port and can be removed due to aging.

An Ethernet VLAN (Virtual Local Area Network) is a technology that allows segmentation of a physical network into multiple logical networks, improving network performance, enhancing security, and simplifying management. Segmentation: VLANs divide a single physical network into multiple logical networks. Each VLAN acts as a separate forwarding and learning domain, separating frames from devices in the different VLANs. Tagging: VLANs use frame tagging (IEEE 802.1Q) to identify which VLAN a particular Ethernet frame belongs to. VLAN ID: Each VLAN is assigned a unique identifier called a VLAN ID, which ranges from 1 to 4094. VLANs are configured on network switches with a number of member ports. Frames in a VLAN can only be forwarded between member ports. Access Ports: These ports are assigned to a single VLAN and are typically used to connect end devices like computers and printers. Trunk Ports: These ports can carry traffic from multiple VLANs and are used to connect switches to each other. Frame tagging is used to identify which VLAN the traffic belongs to. Tagging behavior depends on the type of port. Access Ports: When a frame ingresses the port, it is classified to the VLAN ID associated with that port. Any tag in the frame is preserved. When a frame egresses the port, a tag is NOT pushed with the classified VLAN ID. Trunk Ports: When a frame ingresses the port, it is classified to the VLAN ID based on the VID in the tag. The tag in the frame is NOT preserved (popped). When a frame egresses the port, a tag is pushed with the classified VLAN ID. When a switch receives a frame, it uses the classified VLAN ID and forwards the frame only to ports that are part of that VLAN. The switch can be configured with a Custom EtherType that can be the recognized Tag EtherType on a Custom-Tag aware port. The port type has to be configured as provider-custom-network-port to be Custom-Tag aware. In the following, the interface (port) name '1' is used. Let’s see that the port type is d-bridge-port (TAG un-aware) by default: FETCH request message: - \"/ietf-interfaces:interfaces/interface[name='1']/\\ ieee802-dot1q-bridge:bridge-port/port-type\" FETCH response message: - ? \"/ietf-interfaces:interfaces/interface/ieee802-dot1q-bridge:bridge-port/\\ port-type\" : ieee802-dot1q-bridge:d-bridge-port Let’s see that the switch Custom EtherType is 0x88A8 (S-TAG) by default: FETCH request message: - \"/ieee802-dot1q-bridge:bridges/bridge[name='b0']/component[name='c0']/\\ mchp-velocitysp-bridge:custom-ethertype\" FETCH response message: - ? \"/ieee802-dot1q-bridge:bridges/bridge/component/\\ mchp-velocitysp-bridge:custom-ethertype\" : 34984 The following two requests will configure the switch Custom EtherType to be 0x5555 and the port type as Custom-Tag aware on port '1': iPATCH request message: - ? \"/ieee802-dot1q-bridge:bridges/bridge[name='b0']/component[name='c0']/\\ mchp-velocitysp-bridge:custom-ethertype\" : 21845 iPATCH request message: - ? \"/ietf-interfaces:interfaces/interface[name='1']/\\ ieee802-dot1q-bridge:bridge-port/port-type\" : mchp-velocitysp-bridge:provider-custom-network-port Now an ingress frame on port '1' with an outer Tag containing EtherType 0x5555 is considered a tagged frame and is classified to the VLAN according to the VID in the Tag. On port '1' egress, a pushed Tag will contain EtherType 0x5555. Ingress frames can be discarded based on the inner (second) tag. By default, there is no discard on the inner tag enabled - the inner tag is considered as data. There are the following possibilities: No Tag: Discard if there is no inner tag - tag is required. Any Tag: Discard if there is any tag - tag is not accepted. C-Tag: Discard if there is a C-Tag (EtherType 0x8100). S-Tag: Discard if there is an S-Tag (EtherType 0x88A0).

Two important concepts: On a TAG un-aware port, the ingress frame (tagged or un-tagged) is classified to VLAN based on port default VID. On a TAG aware port, the ingress frame is classified to VLAN based on TAG VID. The ports involved: Access Port1: TAG un-aware, any frames accepted. Classified to VLAN10. Access Port2: TAG un-aware, any frames accepted. Classified to VLAN20. Trunk Port3: TAG aware and only C-Tagged frames accepted. Classified to outer TAG VID. The VLANs: A VLAN10 is created with Port1 and Port3 as members. A VLAN20 is created with Port2 and Port3 as members. In this example: Frames on Port1 are un-tagged. Frames on Port2 are tagged. Frames on Port3 are tagged and double-tagged. Forwarding: Frames are forwarded between Port1 and Port3 on VLAN10. Frames are forwarded between Port2 and Port3 on VLAN20.

Direct to CoAP access on UDP port 5683 is now blocked. Assuming that the security mode is set to 'raw-public-key' then all client access to CoAP must be authenticated. VelocitySP maintains a short list of authorized client keys. However, at first startup there are no authorized client keys listed. You can check this with the following command. FETCH request message - \"/ietf-system:system/authentication\" FETCH response message - ? \"/ietf-system:system/authentication\" : user: [] As you can see, initially, there are no authorized users, and VelocitySP is considered non-provisioned. In this state, all secured CoAP servers are blocked until after the provisioning process has been completed. Before we continue, lets review the current state. Security mode is set to 'raw-public-key' which means direct to CoAP on UDP port 5683 is blocked, and DTLS to CoAP is enabled on UDP port 5684. Also VelocitySP is in the 'non-provisioned' state which means normal CoAP server URI_PATHs (such as '/c') are blocked. And only the provisioning URI_PATH is enabled at '/p'. Additionally, in this 'non-provisioned' state authentication checks are disabled. Which means any client may provision itself as the admin client. But this can only be done once. After VelocitySP has the admin client key, then it is 'provisioned', authentication checking is enabled in DTLS, and normal CoAP server URI_PATHs are enabled. Now lets proceed to provision the device. This is done by simply issuing a CoAPS GET request on '/p', through DTLS on UDP port 5684. You can do this using openssl and libcoap’s coap_client tool. First generate your admin client key using openssl. openssl ecparam -name prime256v1 -genkey -noout -out admin_keys.pem Then using your new admin key, initiate the provisioning with the following. coap-client -m get -M admin_keys.pem coaps:///p If successful you should see the content returned is \"PROVISIONED\" During the DTLS handshake, the client key is stored, and when CoAP processes the get request on '/p' it saves the client key as the admin key. To verify the new admin key is saved issue the following request FETCH request message - \"/ietf-system:system/authentication\" FETCH response message - ? \"/ietf-system:system/authentication\" : user: - name: admin mchp-velocitysp-system:coap-authorized-key: - name: admin key-data: rKpMtVOxomldA11CKrVJtEAh0Pc1ztYugYfpe0lFf0kzk29u10whRF5SU/E2ztXMqUp8SXXbONYJstAFTcmMqg== access-control: cc-rights: read-write startup-config-rights: read-write fw-rights: read-write dbg-rights: read-write well-known-rights: read-write Obviously your key-data will be different, but notice the admin key has read-write access to all CoAP servers. Therefor you can now use admin_keys.pem with your coap_client to access all available servers. For example, to get the full runtime config in cbor do the following. coap-client -m get -M admin_keys.pem coaps:///c VelocitySP maintains a short list of authorized users and keys.

This covers multiple PTP profiles: gPTP automotive gPTP Configure the HW to generate a 1PPS on one of the PTP pins. This feature can be used for example to check that two different HWs are synchronized by checking the 1PPS and make sure that is aligned. The 1PPS will be generated whenever the second part will increment. This will be generated regardless timestamping is enabled or not or even if there is a servo or not. The 1PPS can be adjusted only when the local time counter is adjusted. For example when the frequency is increased or there is a jump in time. The local time counter can be adjusted only if there is a servo and that servo is in slave state. So if there is no servo then the local time will not be adjusted to any other remote GMs. The ptp-pin that is used here is just an example and needs to be set according to the schematic of the board. iPATCH request message: - ? \"/ieee1588-ptp:ptp/mchp-velocitysp-ptp:ltcs/ltc\" : ltc-index: 1 ptp-pins: ptp-pin: - index: 4 function: 1pps-out This will show how to stop generating 1PPS on that PTP port. iPATCH request message: - ? \"/ieee1588-ptp:ptp/mchp-velocitysp-ptp:ltcs/ltc[ltc-index='1']\" : Configure the HW to behave like a ordinary clock.

The value is represented in nanoseconds with a 16 bit sub fractional port. If this value is bigger than the mean-link-delay-thresh then the port will not be as-capable meaning that the port state is disabled port-state: this will say what is the current port state. It can be in one of the following: master: it would send out SYNC and FOLLOW_UP frames with the information that it received on the slave port, or if the DUT is a GM with its own local timer. slave: it would receive SYNC and FOLLOW_UP frames from partner with the time information. disabled: the port will be in this state, if the port is not as-capable passive: the port will be in this state if there another port on the DUT that has the same information from the master. parent-port-identity: describes the partner port that send out the ANNOUNCE frame grandmaster-identity: describes the GM of the network Delete the PTP instance that was created. iPATCH request message: - ? \"/ieee1588-ptp:ptp/instances/instance[instance-index='0']\" : When adding multiple ports under a PTP instance and not having a servo then the PTP instance will behave as an relay as described in 802.1AS. iPATCH request message: - ? \"/ieee1588-ptp:ptp/instances/instance\" : instance-index: 0 ports: port: - port-index: 25 - port-index: 26 When operating in this mode the local time is not updated to any remove grandmasters.

The main differences between Auto GPTP and GPTP are: Grandmaster Information and Topology: there should not be any Announce messages in the topology as there is no BMCA running because it presumes that the topology doesn’t change and it is know from start which is the GM asCpable: If the port has a link, then it presumes that the port is asCapable, in this way it improves the bring up time of the network initialLogPdelayReqInterval: there is an initial interval of the peer delay request (1 frame per second) and it is using this interval until the mean path delay is stabalized. The standard doesn’t explain what means stabalized but in implementation it means 2 consecutive mean path delays to have the same value. operLogPdelayReqInterval: the interval of peer delay requests after the link has stablized. (1 frame every 2 second). syncReceiptTimeout: In case the AED-B stops receiving Sync frames, then it should continue to send out frames with the last received information, or if the AED-B doesn’t receive at all Sync frames from beginning then it is required for AED-B to start to send own Sync frames with a fix preciseOriginTimestamp.

These guides are intended for users to get started with a given feature. Typically, the individual guide will provide some background and/or introduction to a given feature, and then follow up with hands-on examples on how to configure and/or inspect status. All the examples in this material will be showing requests and responses in RFC7951 inspired format. See this section for details on the request/response format. This format has been chosen as it allows us to explain the features and provide examples in a client-agnostic way. This means that readers who want to try out the examples will need to adapt the shown request into a format accepted by the desired client. The intention with these guides is to introduce the topic and offer some ready to use requests and responses which the reader can try out while reading. This material is intended for all users of a Microchip evaluation board running VelocityDRIVE-SP who have an interest in managing the switch using the CORECONF interface, regardless of what client will be used. To actually try the requests shown in the configuration guides, the following is needed: A supported board with VelocityDRIVE-SP firmware A CORECONF client and a PC to run the client code Connectivity between the client and the board. Following is a list of suitable clients: mup1cc: This client uses RFC7951 natively, meaning that requests are given in this format, and responses are printed in this format. The getting started guide contains all the details on how to get, install, and use the tool. This is the most straightforward client to use along with the configuration guides. VelocityDRIVE-CT: This is a GUI PC-based client intended for interactive use. Users of this client will typically be using the mouse to navigate the YANG tree, and then enter the values in the relevant leaves. But it is worth noting that the naming of all containers, lists, leaves, etc. are the same in the RFC7951 format as the names used in this client. Both RFC7951 and VelocityDRIVE-CT are generated from the same YANG models. Customer developed client: If integrating VelocityDRIVE-SP in systems where the switch needs to be controlled or monitored by other devices, it is typically best to do a custom client. Here the configuration guides can still be used to help understand the feature, and get some pointers to what YANG modules, containers, lists, and/or leaves shall be used. The client needs to have connectivity to the management interface of the switch in order to function. If using mup1cc, then the connectivity is a point-to-point UART connection and requires no configuration of the switch. The UART configuration is: 115200 1N8. VelocityDRIVE-CT supports both MUP1 (UART connection) and IP-based connection. If using MUP1/UART then no configuration is needed, but if using IP connection is desired, then an IP management address needs to be configured on the switch. This initial configuration needs to be configured using the P2P MUP/UART connection. The IP address configuration for simple instructions, or read Management IP page for more details. The configuration guides are intended to help users get started with a given feature, but are not intended to be a complete reference of all the supported YANG elements. The full reference of what is supported shall be found in the YANG catalog. Client tools typically download the YANG catalog in the background and use this to construct the UI and/or to format the messages (see this for more details). But when working with the configuration guides alone, and/or if using the mup1cc tool, it is useful to inspect the YANG catalog to see the full interface specification. An HTML version of the YANG catalog is compiled in its own page, and can be seen here.","title":"Switch Configuration Guides","component":"vd-docs","version":"2025.03","name":"doc-cg","url":"/vd-docs/2025.03/doc-cg.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

The tools covered in this section are command-line tools, running in a Linux environment (can run under Windows if using WSL or VirtualBox). Microchip also offers a Windows GUI tool which can be used to interact with switches running VelocityDRIVE-SP. Many users may find it easier to get started using the GUI tools. To get access to this tool, contact your sales or support representatives from Microchip and ask for VelocityDRIVE-CT. Users who decide to use VelocityDRIVE-CT instead of the command-line tools described here can still benefit from reading the configuration guides. The basic setup should look like this: As a prerequisite to this document, the following is needed: A supported evaluation board with VelocityDRIVE-SP Check the list of VelocityDRIVE-SP supported EVBs here A PC capable of providing a Linux environment Either a native Linux PC, VirtualBox hosting a Linux installation, or WSL Certain tools need to be installed which will require root access Access to serial ports (UART/tty) from the Linux environment To get started with a new evaluation board, it is a good idea to start by confirming the basic UART connectivity. To do this, add power to the board and connect the USB console to the host PC, and open the UART using a terminal emulation program like minicom, picocom, putty, or teraterm. The UART/serial settings must be configured as follows: flowcontrol : none baudrate : 115200 parity : none databits : 8 stopbits : 1 Here we will use picocom to connect to /dev/ttyACM0: $ picocom -b 115200 /dev/ttyACM0 The VelocityDRIVE-SP firmware will only print an announce frame once at boot, and after this, it will remain silent until a request is received or a trace message is issued. To see if VelocityDRIVE-SP is loaded on the board and capable of running, it is easiest to hit the reset button while your terminal emulation application of choice is still running. Doing so should result in the following message being seen in the console: >AVelocitySP-v2024.12 0 300 2 marker. The character following the start-of-frame marker is a type field, and here A means announcement. The end-of-frame marker is marked by a pPVelocitySP-v2024.12 80553 300 2 /tmp/before $ # Connect the device $ ls /dev > /tmp/after $ diff /tmp/before /tmp/after # to see what changed 20a21 > gpiochip1 37a39 > i2c-3 151a154 > ttyACM0 If no devices can be identified using these methods, then check the cables, and/or if the Linux machine being used has the needed drivers. Some distributions install all kernel drivers as modules. If the system has been updated, and a new kernel has been installed, and the system has not been rebooted, then it is likely the modules belonging to the running kernel have been deleted, and cannot be loaded. In this case, some dmesg messages are seen, but no device is attached. To fix this, remember to reboot the system after kernel updates. All the following examples will use /dev/ttyACM0. Make sure to use the correct name on your system. When opening the terminal emulation application, a permission-related error is printed. In this case, check the permission of the serial port device and the credentials of your current user: $ ls -la /dev/ttyACM0 # check serial port permissions crw-rw---- 1 root uucp 166, 0 Jan 29 14:10 /dev/ttyACM0 $ id # check credentials of current user uid=1000(user) gid=1000(user) groups=1000(user),5(tty),100(users),971(docker),986(uucp) Here the serial port is owned by the root user, and the uucp group. Access should work as the current user is a member of the uucp group. If permissions are not set up correctly, the easiest solution is often to give everybody access: $ sudo chmod a+rw /dev/ttyACM0 $ ls -la /dev/ttyACM0 crw-rw-rw- 1 root uucp 166, 0 Jan 29 14:10 /dev/ttyACM0 After this, all users with access to the system have access to the UART. The majority of this guide will use tools from the velocitydrivesp-support repository. Let’s start by cloning this repository: $ git clone https://github.com/microchip-ung/velocitydrivesp-support $ cd velocitydrivesp-support The easiest and recommended way to use the tools just cloned is to run them through a small script called dr which will simply start a docker container, run the requested command, and then stop the docker container again. If for some reason it is not desired to use dr and docker, then it is still possible to use the scripts in this repository. But the majority of the scripts are written in Ruby and have various dependencies. To prepare a PC to run these examples without docker, then use the dockerfile here to see the list of packages installed. To install dr, run the following command (to learn more about dr, check the readme file here). $ sudo curl -o /usr/local/bin/dr https://raw.githubusercontent.com/microchip-ung/docker-run/refs/heads/main/dr $ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/dr The next step is to confirm that docker is installed, running, and working. $ docker images This should print a (possibly empty) list of images. If it does so, skip the rest of this session. If you see any kind of error, then continue. The following steps will show how to install docker on a Fedora 40 workstation: # On Fedora 41 $ sudo dnf install docker-cli docker-ce containerd # On Fedora 40 $ sudo dnf install moby-engine containerd Docker needs a backend service running, let’s start that: $ sudo systemctl enable --now docker Add the current user to the docker group: $ sudo usermod -aG docker $USER Logout and login again to have the list of groups updated (or run newgrp docker to join the group in the current session without logging out and in again). Now let’s repeat the command to list images and see if it works: $ docker images If this is still not successful, then please seek help to get docker working properly before continuing. Now that docker is installed and working, we are ready to use dr for the first time. The dr script will look for a file called .docker.env and if the configured docker image is not downloaded, it will start by downloading it. Let’s invoke a simple command to check this: $ dr ls If running for the first time, then you will see some docker output downloading the image. Depending on network speed, this will take from a few minutes to hours to complete. Once the download has completed, then the ls command will run and the content of the folder should be listed. When using the dr command after this, the docker image will be cached, and it should only take a second or two to bring up the docker image where the command is invoked. It is possible to run dr bash to open a long-lived interactive bash shell within the docker image. This can be faster if using a small PC where it takes a long time to spin up an image, or if using a std-in/out/err redirection which can also be confusing when using the dr command. With docker fully configured, and a board confirmed to run VelocityDRIVE-SP, we are ready to do some basic management of the board. This section will present some copy-paste’able commands/examples which we encourage new users to try out. All the examples here will be using the mup1cc tool which is part of the docker image. Most of the examples in this section will start by preparing a request message which is written to a file, and then use this file in the following command. To do this, we use the here document syntax and pipe the content into a file. This is just a convenient way to make the commands copy-paste’able, but at the end of the day, it does not matter how the content in the file is written - as long as it is written correctly. Let’s start by confirming that the script can run, by invoking the script with the help option (output has been truncated): $ dr mup1cc --help Usage: /home/m31684/work/sw-lmstax4/support/scripts/mup1cc [options] -h, --help The MUP1CC help ... The mup1cc tool can be used to access the CORECONF resources over MUP1, and when doing so, it will convert between the CBOR encoding which is what it does on the wire, and a variant of RFC7951 encoding which is used as input and output for this tool. For a more in-depth description of CORECONF, CBOR, and RFC7951, please reference the documents in the technology section. This tool only works if no other process has opened the serial device. Make sure to close any open terminal emulators. As a first step, let’s get the running configuration along with the status and counters of the entire switch. To do this, the serial device must be specified using the -d flag, and the CoAP method must be set to get using the -m flag: $ dr mup1cc -d /dev/ttyACM0 -m get Opening serial port at /dev/ttyACM0 --- ietf-interfaces:interfaces: interface: - name: '1' type: iana-if-type:ethernetCsmacd enabled: true oper-status: down if-index: 1 phys-address: 22-94-0D-28-97-01 statistics: in-octets: '0' in-unicast-pkts: '0' in-broadcast-pkts: '0' ... Let’s try to get the interface status of port 1 and 2: $ cat fetch-req-port-get.yaml - \"/ietf-interfaces:interfaces/interface[name='1']\" - \"/ietf-interfaces:interfaces/interface[name='2']\" EOF $ dr mup1cc -d /dev/ttyACM0 -m fetch -i fetch-req-port-get.yaml Try running the command to see the actual output. As an alternative to the designated point-to-point UART/serial-based communication, it is also possible to do in-band management using an IPv4 network. To do this, we need to create an L3 interface and assign an IP address. For a full explanation of how the IP configuration ties into the VLAN configuration, see the document on IP based management. The RFC7951 encoded CORECONF ipatch request below will create a new L3 interface called L3V1, and it will assign the ip and prefix-length attributes to \"10.0.0.1\" and 24 respectively: $ cat ipatch-req-set-ip.yaml - ? \"/ietf-interfaces:interfaces/interface\" : name: \"L3V1\" type: iana-if-type:l3ipvlan ietf-ip:ipv4: address: - ip: \"10.0.0.1\" prefix-length: 24 EOF $ dr mup1cc -d /dev/ttyACM0 -m ipatch -i ipatch-req-set-ip.yaml Once this is done, it would be possible to do a simple ping test (remember to connect and configure the host PC accordingly). The firmware is designed to be secure by default, which is a great help to do secure installations, but if the setup is being used for development, it can be desirable to start without the security layer enabled. As of VelocityDRIVE-CT-2024.12 release, DTLS is not supported in the Windows tool. It is a roadmap item which we are working on, but for now, it is also required to disable DTLS if using VelocityDRIVE-CT to manage the DUT over an IPv4 network. Setting security mode to no-sec also disables authentication entirely. This configuration should only be used in an environment which is secured by other means, or where security and authentication are not needed. The request below simply sets the security mode to no-sec which means that DTLS is disabled. $ cat ipatch-req-no-sec.yaml - \"/mchp-velocitysp-system:coap-server/config/security-mode\": \"no-sec\" EOF $ dr mup1cc -d /dev/ttyACM0 -m ipatch -i ipatch-req-no-sec.yaml Once the request is completed, the configuration must be saved in startup-config, and the device needs to be reset to apply the new security configuration. This is the only configuration change which requires a reboot; all other configurations are applied directly. To save the configuration, an RPC needs to be triggered as shown below: $ cat rpc-req-save-running.yaml - \"/mchp-velocitysp-system:save-config\": EOF $ dr mup1cc -d /dev/ttyACM0 -m post -i rpc-req-save-running.yaml We can now finally reboot the device and connect to it over IP without DTLS: $ cat rpc-req-restart.yaml - \"/ietf-system:system-restart\": EOF $ dr mup1cc -d /dev/ttyACM0 -m post -i rpc-req-restart.yaml","title":"Getting Started","component":"vd-docs","version":"2025.03","name":"doc-getting-started","url":"/vd-docs/2025.03/doc-getting-started.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

Here are some of the important characteristics of VelocityDRIVE-SP: Targeting automotive and industrial markets. Designed for safety and security. Software for constrained environments. The supported switch families typically have on-chip SRAM, and VelocityDRIVE-SP is designed to fit in this memory, not requiring any external DDR. The LAN969x family of SoCs has 2MB of on-chip memory SRAM, which is enough to host the full system. YANG-based management interface The stack implements a CoAP server and on top of this a CORECONF server implementing the relevant YANG modules from IETF and IEEE. Typical L2 protocols ready to use: Basic IP stack for IP-based management, PTP, LACP, IPv4 static routing, etc. VelocityDRIVE is the name of a family of related products. Besides VelocityDRIVE-SP, which is documented in detail in this material, the family also contains VelocityDRIVE-CT, which is a PC tool capable of managing switches running VelocityDRIVE-SP using the CORECONF/YANG interface.

Examples of cases where other licenses apply are in the YANG files provided by IETF and IEEE. The full license can be seen here: CC-BY-SA-4.0.txt. This material is intended for Microchip customers using VelocityDRIVE-SP binary firmware images. The typical use scenarios are: Potential Microchip customers evaluating a Switch SoC on an EVB with VelocityDRIVE-SP pre-installed. Customers who have licensed VelocityDRIVE-SP binaries and are tailoring it for their own board which may differ from the Microchip EVBs. Customers who have already evaluated VelocityDRIVE-SP and are now in the process of integrating it into their network, monitoring, and management system. Customers who have licensed VelocityDRIVE-SP sources, but still need documentation on how to use the binaries generated from these sources. This material is not intended to be used directly by third parties to Microchip (customers of Microchip customers). VelocityDRIVE-SP binaries include all the firmware needed on a single switch. This firmware facilitates booting the switch, applying configuration, running protocols, and allowing the switch to be managed. In this material, a switch is defined as the entire \"board\" or \"box\" which includes the Switch-SoC, PHYs, flash, etc. This is illustrated in the figure below. But, for switches to be useful, they need to be connected to a network and forward traffic. This network needs to be designed, built/implemented, monitored, etc. The entire network design and network management is out of scope of this material. The configuration guides may in some places show diagrams and configurations of networks containing multiple nodes, but the overall focus in this material is on a single DUT, and let the reader use this information to design complete networks. This document contains the following parts: Getting Started: Basic but important steps to help new users get started using one of the supported evaluation boards. YANG Catalog: The YANG catalog offers a complete reference of all YANG elements implemented in a given firmware release. The YANG catalog is provided as an attachment (right click to download) here. Configuration Guides: This part focuses on the CORECONF/YANG management interface. Most of the material here is focused on network configuration and status, and it provides a good amount of example configuration which can be applied and evaluated directly on the evaluation boards. Supported EVBs: This part enumerates the supported EVBs, and also provides most of the information which is specific to a given SoC family or board. This includes, but is not limited to, dip-switches, flashing/de-brick instructions, features/capabilities of a given board, etc. Software Tailoring: This part is only intended for customers who are designing their own boards and need to tailor the software to run on this board.

The board configuration itself is guarded by a YANG schema file which describes all the fields which can be configured and encoded as CBOR as defined by RFC9254. The board.yang is different from all the other YANG modules in the system as it is not exposed over CORECONF, and completely invisible to the end-user. The board-yang data belong to the firmware image and are signed along with that image, and therefore being considered as part of the firmware. CBOR is a compact and machine-friendly encoding, but not very human-friendly, and for this reason, the actual board configurations are written in YAML format, and then converted to CBOR. The build system takes care of doing that. When reading this material, one should have the board.tree and board.yang files open, and reference them. The high-level structure of the board.tree looks like this: module: board +--rw drivers | ... +--rw capabilities | ... +--rw factory_default_config? | ... +--rw extmod | ... A basic and empty board configuration YAML template can look like this: board:drivers: board:capabilities: board:factory_default_config: The following section will go into detail with each of the major sections SGPIOs (Serial GPIOs) are used for communication with devices on the board such as SFP modules and LEDs. Up to 32 SGPIO ports can be enabled, with each port consisting of 1-4 bits. This configuration results in a serial data stream comprising 'ports * bits' number of GPIOs. The definition looks like this: module: board +--rw drivers +--rw sgpio_banks +--rw sgpio_bank* [sgpio_bank] +--rw sgpio_bank dev_sgpio_bank +--rw bit_count uint32 +--rw port_mask uint32 +--rw clock_div? uint32 +--rw pin_ctrl +--rw pins* uint32 +--rw pin_function pin_function sgpio_bank is used to select which physical instance in hardware to configure; typically, 1-3 instances are available. bit_count is the number of GPIOs (or bits) that are enabled per SGPIO port, with 1-4 bits available. port_mask defines the SGPIO ports that get enabled. Some signals (e.g., SFP LOS) are mapped directly to the chip device with the same number as the SGPIO port in this mask. clock_div maps directly into the hardware where the SGPIO frequency is set. The resulting frequency is the system clock divided by this value. pin_ctrl is used to assign physical pins on the SoC to this function. Check the datasheet for an overview of which pins can be used. Example with SGPIO ports 0,1,24,25,26,27 enabled, with 4 bits per port: sgpio_banks: sgpio_bank: - sgpio_bank: DEV_SGPIO_BANK_0 bit_count: 4 port_mask: 0x0F000003 clock_div: 65 pin_ctrl: pins: [5, 6, 7, 8] pin_function: alt1 FlexCOM is a SoC HW component capable of providing a UART, I2C, or SPI interface. The definition of the FlexCOM in the board.tree looks like this: +--rw drivers +--rw flexcoms +--rw flexcom* [hw_instance] +--rw hw_instance uint32 +--rw uart? dev_uart +--rw i2c? dev_i2c +--rw spi? dev_spi +--rw pin_ctrl +--rw pins* uint32 +--rw pin_function pin_function Here: hw_instance is used to select which physical instance in HW to configure. Typically a SoC supports 2-5 instances, and each instance can only be configured to work with a fixed pool of pins. It is therefore important to configure the correct instance (according to the schematic). uart, i2c, and spi are used to select the personality of the FlexCOM instance. Any given flexcom entry must include one and only one of them. The DEV_xxx value assigned to either uart, i2c, or spi is an internal handle, used further down in the file to reference the FlexCOM instance. pin_ctrl is used to assign physical pins on the SoC to this function. Check the datasheet for an overview of what pins can be used. Following is an example where FlexCom-0 is configured as UART, and FlexCOM-3 is configured as an I2C controller: board:drivers: flexcoms: flexcom: - hw_instance: 0 uart: DEV_UART_0 pin_ctrl: pins: [3, 4] pin_function: alt1 - hw_instance: 3 i2c: DEV_I2C_0 pin_ctrl: pins: [55, 56] pin_function: alt2 See also: MUP1 and I2C Mux. Pin group is used to configure and manage the multiplexing of pins to allow multiple devices to share the same physical pins. The pins can be either GPIOs or SGPIOs. The typical usage is to control a mux to I2C devices. The definition looks like this: module: board +--rw drivers +--rw pin_groups +--rw pin_group* [pin_group] +--rw pin_group dev_pin_group +--rw sleep uint32 +--ro mux_pins* [] +--ro (ref) | +--:(sgpio) | | +--ro sgpio | | +--ro ref_sgpio_bank dev_sgpio_bank | | +--ro port uint8 | | +--ro bit uint8 | +--:(gpio) | +--ro gpio? uint32 +--ro direction gpio_direction +--ro active_state? active pin_group is the internal handle for others to reference when choosing a pin group. sleep is the time it takes to change the mux, i.e., the driver waits this number of ms before returning and the mux is formed. sgpio defines a reference to an SGPIO bank and which port/bit are used to form the group. gpio has the same purpose as sgpio, just for GPIOs. Example of a pin group formed by 3 SGPIO pins, wich can contol mux with up to 8 outputs: pin_groups: pin_group: - pin_group: DEV_PIN_GROUP_0 sleep: 10 mux_pins: - sgpio: ref_sgpio_bank: DEV_SGPIO_BANK_0 port: 0 bit: 1 direction: GPIO_DIR_OUT - sgpio: ref_sgpio_bank: DEV_SGPIO_BANK_0 port: 0 bit: 2 direction: GPIO_DIR_OUT - sgpio: ref_sgpio_bank: DEV_SGPIO_BANK_0 port: 0 bit: 3 direction: GPIO_DIR_OUT I2C Mux is used to control a number of I2C devices (which share the same I2C bus) by enabling only one of them at a time and keeping the others disabled. Users will reference the MUX based on how it should be configured with 'DEV_MUX_x'. The definition looks like this: module: board +--rw drivers +--rw i2c_muxs +--rw i2c_mux* [i2c_mux] +--rw i2c_mux dev_i2c_mux +--rw ref_parent dev_i2c +--rw ref_pin_group dev_pin_group +--rw gpio_mask uint32 i2c_mux is the internal handle for others to reference when choosing an I2C mux with a specific mux configuration. ref_parent is a reference to an already defined HW I2C instance. ref_pin_group is a reference to an already defined pin controller. gpio_mask defines how this instance will configure the mux. Example of an I2C MUX which uses the pin group and the I2C instance above and sets the MUX to positions 0-3. i2c_muxs: i2c_mux: - i2c_mux: DEV_MUX_0 ref_parent: DEV_I2C_0 ref_pin_group: DEV_PIN_GROUP_0 gpio_mask: 0 - i2c_mux: DEV_MUX_1 ref_parent: DEV_I2C_0 ref_pin_group: DEV_PIN_GROUP_0 gpio_mask: 1 - i2c_mux: DEV_MUX_2 ref_parent: DEV_I2C_0 ref_pin_group: DEV_PIN_GROUP_0 gpio_mask: 2 - i2c_mux: DEV_MUX_3 ref_parent: DEV_I2C_0 ref_pin_group: DEV_PIN_GROUP_0 gpio_mask: 3 The SFP signals that are defined consist of the following: LOS (input), TX_FAULT (input), PRESENT (input), and TX_ENABLE (output). When inserted, 'PRESENT' goes high and the ROM is read via I2C to determine the type and thereby how to configure the switch port to match its capabilities. The definition looks like this: module: board +--rw drivers +--rw sfps +--rw sfp* [portno] +--rw los | +--rw (ref) | | +--:(sgpio) | | | +--rw sgpio | | | +--rw ref_sgpio_bank dev_sgpio_bank | | | +--rw port uint8 | | | +--rw bit uint8 | | +--:(gpio) | | +--rw gpio? uint32 | +--rw direction gpio_direction | +--rw active_state? active +--rw tx_fault | +--rw (ref) | | +--:(sgpio) | | | +--rw sgpio | | | +--rw ref_sgpio_bank dev_sgpio_bank | | | +--rw port uint8 | | | +--rw bit uint8 | | +--:(gpio) | | +--rw gpio? uint32 | +--rw direction gpio_direction | +--rw active_state? active +--rw present | +--rw (ref) | | +--:(sgpio) | | | +--rw sgpio | | | +--rw ref_sgpio_bank dev_sgpio_bank | | | +--rw port uint8 | | | +--rw bit uint8 | | +--:(gpio) | | +--rw gpio? uint32 | +--rw direction gpio_direction | +--rw active_state? active +--rw tx_enable | +--rw (ref) | | +--:(sgpio) | | | +--rw sgpio | | | +--rw ref_sgpio_bank dev_sgpio_bank | | | +--rw port uint8 | | | +--rw bit uint8 | | +--:(gpio) | | +--rw gpio? uint32 | +--rw direction gpio_direction | +--rw active_state? active +--rw portno uint32 +--rw ref_i2c_mux? dev_i2c_mux portno defines to which switch front port (zero-based) this SFP belongs. los indicates a loss of the received optical signal. present indicates that a module is present. tx_enable signal is used to enable the transmitter output. tx_fault indicates faults in the Tx direction. direction can be either input or output (output for tx_enable, input for others). active_state defines the signal’s active state. This is usually documented in schematics. sgpio/gpio section defines how the signals are mapped to either SGPIO port/bit or GPIO ID. ref_i2c_mux is a reference to an already defined I2C mux, which enables this SFP I2C. Example of a single SFP implementation: sfps: sfp: - portno: 24 ref_i2c_mux: DEV_MUX_0 los: sgpio: ref_sgpio_bank: DEV_SGPIO_BANK_0 port: 24 bit: 0 direction: GPIO_DIR_IN active_state: high tx_fault: sgpio: ref_sgpio_bank: DEV_SGPIO_BANK_0 port: 24 bit: 2 direction: GPIO_DIR_IN active_state: high present: sgpio: ref_sgpio_bank: DEV_SGPIO_BANK_0 port: 24 bit: 1 direction: GPIO_DIR_IN active_state: low tx_enable: sgpio: ref_sgpio_bank: DEV_SGPIO_BANK_0 port: 24 bit: 2 direction: GPIO_DIR_OUT active_state: low The MDIO (Management Data Input/Output) is a serial bus protocol used for PHY access. There are usually 1-3 buses available on the SoC, and each PHY will reference which bus they belong to. module: board +--rw drivers +--rw mdios +--rw mdio* [miim_bus] +--rw miim_bus miim_bus +--rw pin_ctrl | +--rw pins* uint32 | +--rw pin_function pin_function +--rw frequency? uint32 miim_bus is the bus ID, used for reference. pin_ctrl is used to assign physical pins on the SoC to this function. Check the datasheet for an overview of what pins can be used. frequency is the MIIM bus frequency in Hz. Leave out for default SoC frequency. Example of an MDIO: mdios: mdio: - miim_bus: MIIM_BUS_0 frequency: 2500000 pin_ctrl: pins: [9, 10] pin_function: alt1 MUP1 is a UART protocol facilitating configuring and inspecting the status of the Switch using the UART. MUP1 is a SW function, but it needs to know which UART device it shall use. This is done by setting a handle, which ties it to the HW instance of the same handle (typically a FlexCom). The definition of the MUP1 in the board.tree looks like this: module: board +--rw drivers +--rw mup1 +--rw ref_uart? dev_uart Following is an example connecting the MUP1 function to the HW instance using DEV_UART_0. board:drivers: mup1: ref_uart: DEV_UART_0 See also: FlexCom The GPIO for Board restart is defined here. A board restart can e.g. be performed from management.

This is usually documented in schematics. Example: gpio_restart: gpio: 60 direction: GPIO_DIR_OUT active_state: low This reset is an input signal (activated by pressing a button) that indicates a reset-to-default should be performed. The SoC will immediately reset and read this signal during startup (state of the reset button). If active, the configuration is restored to default. The definition looks like this: module: board +--rw drivers +--rw gpio_reset +--rw (ref) | +--:(sgpio) | | +--rw sgpio | | +--rw ref_sgpio_bank dev_sgpio_bank | | +--rw port uint8 | | +--rw bit uint8 | +--:(gpio) | +--rw gpio? uint32 +--rw direction gpio_direction +--rw active_state? active sgpio/gpio section defines how the signals are mapped to either SGPIO port/bit or GPIO ID. direction is input. active_state defines the signal’s active state.

This is usually documented in schematics. Example: status_led: gpio: 61 direction: GPIO_DIR_OUT active_state: low The PHY’s reset state is controlled through the pin defined here. module: board +--rw drivers +--rw phy_reset +--rw (ref) | +--:(sgpio) | | +--rw sgpio | | +--rw ref_sgpio_bank dev_sgpio_bank | | +--rw port uint8 | | +--rw bit uint8 | +--:(gpio) | +--rw gpio? uint32 +--rw direction gpio_direction +--rw active_state? active sgpio/gpio section defines how the signals are mapped to either SGPIO port/bit or GPIO ID. direction is output. active_state defines the signal’s active state. This is usually documented in schematics. Example: phy_reset: gpio: 62 direction: GPIO_DIR_OUT active_state: low The watchdog is a hardware timer and helps to ensure the system can recover from unforeseen failures. It reboots the system if its timer has not been updated by the CPU within a period that is set here. If left out, then the watchdog is disabled. module: board +--rw drivers +--rw watchdog +--rw timeout? enumeration Example, when timeout is set to 2 seconds: watchdog: timeout: timeout_2000ms This section defines how the front port LEDs should be accessed, typically SFP-based LEDs. Each switch port typically has two LEDs: green for 'high' speed and a second one (red/yellow/orange, etc.) for 'low' speed. Note that the PHYs usually control the LEDs directly through their own GPIOs and do not require any board configuration setup. module: board +--rw drivers +--rw port_leds +--rw port_led* [portno] +--rw portno uint32 +--rw led_green | +--rw (ref) | | +--:(sgpio) | | | +--rw sgpio | | | +--rw ref_sgpio_bank dev_sgpio_bank | | | +--rw port uint8 | | | +--rw bit uint8 | | +--:(gpio) | | +--rw gpio? uint32 | +--rw direction gpio_direction | +--rw active_state? active +--rw led_second +--rw (ref) | +--:(sgpio) | | +--rw sgpio | | +--rw ref_sgpio_bank dev_sgpio_bank | | +--rw port uint8 | | +--rw bit uint8 | +--:(gpio) | +--rw gpio? uint32 +--rw direction gpio_direction +--rw active_state? active portno defines to which switch front port (zero-based) these LEDs belong. led_green defines how the green LED is accessed through SGPIOs or GPIOs. led_second defines how the second LED is accessed through SGPIOs or GPIOs. sgpio/gpio section defines how the signals are mapped to either SGPIO port/bit or GPIO ID.

Typically used where PHY access is not possible. base_port is used for quad PHYs for determining which port ID should be used for access of shared resources. fixed_link means that the speed is forced as opposed to 'aneg', and is left out when aneg is enabled. speed defines the speed of the fixed_link. role defines the role (master/slave) of the PHY, and is left out when aneg is enabled. led defines the LED settings for the PHY. Supported for some PHYs. The following example is a bridge with one PHY-based port and one SFP-based port: target_chip: lan9696tsn eth_ports: eth_port: - port_dev: 0 phy_mode: qsgmii phy_chip: 1 bandwidth: 1000 phy: ref_miim_bus: MIIM_BUS_0 miim_addr: 4 base_port: 0 led: - id: led0 mode: link1000_activity - id: led1 mode: link10_100_activity - port_dev: 24 phy_mode: 10gbase-r bandwidth: 10000 Pin configuration of PTP functions. This section defines the GPIO to PTP mapping. module: board +--rw drivers +--rw ptp +--ro pins* [] +--ro pin_ctrl +--ro pins* uint32 +--ro pin_function pin_function pin_ctrl is used to assign physical pins on the SoC to this function. Check the datasheet for an overview of what pins can be used. pins defines the GPIO(s) ID. pin_function defines the mode to configure the pin(s). The following example maps 3 GPIOs to the 1PPS PTP function ALT4: ptp: pins: - pin_ctrl: pins: [57, 58, 59] pin_function: alt4 The capabilities section is used to provide selected configurations for the application. All capability configurations are parsed at boot-time, and if this configuration requires memory to be allocated, then this allocation is done before the MUP1 announce packet is emitted. If too many resources are assigned, it will result in a fatal boot error, and the board-tailor needs to lower the counts. Here is what the capability section looks like in the board.tree: module: board +--rw capabilities +--rw manufacturer string +--rw model string +--rw l3_count? uint32 +--rw ltc_count? uint32 +--rw ltc_pin_count? uint8 +--rw phy_timestamping? boolean +--rw stream_count? uint32 +--rw coap_session_count? uint32 +--rw arp_count? uint32 +--rw ipv4_route_count? uint32 Where: manufacturer: is a string returned by the IETF-HW YANG manufacturer leaf. model: is the model returned in the IETF-System YANG. l3_count?: Is the number of L3 interfaces. This shall be set to 1 on SW variants without routing support, and can be up to 32 on SW variants with routing support. ltc_count?: Is the number of PTP instances (each instance is tied to a PTP domain). Set this to 3, as this is the number of domains supported in HW. ltc_pin_count?: Number of PTP Pins which can be used for 1PPS in/out. phy_timestamping?: Select if PHY time-stamping shall be used (requires PHYs with time-stamping support). stream_count?: Number of PSFP Streams. coap_session_count?: Number of CoAP sessions to support. arp_count?: Number of ARP entries to support. ipv4_route_count?: Number of IPv4 static routes. This shall be set to zero on SW variants without routing, and above 1 on systems with SW routing. Here is an example of the capabilities: board:capabilities: manufacturer: \"Microchip Technology Inc.\" model: \"LAN9698RED - EV89P81A (UNG8422)\" l3_count: 1 ltc_count: 3 ltc_pin_count: 8 phy_timestamping: false stream_count: 64 coap_session_count: 4 arp_count: 64 ipv4_route_count: 0 The factory defaults can contain the full CORECONF data-store, and is applied at boot time if no user-configuration is stored in flash.

This guide will walk you through the velocitydrivesp-lan969x-bin packet. The velocitydrivesp-lan966x-bin (notice lan966x instead of lan969x) is very similar, and users of this packet should use this guide as well. The board tailoring is assumed to be done in a Linux environment capable of running Docker images. This can either be a native Linux environment, WSL, or a virtual machine. See the Prepare of PC environment for guidance on how to install dr and how to setup Docker. The Docker image used here is not available on any public Docker registry and needs to be manually downloaded and imported. The dr command will attempt to lazy download if the Docker image is not found locally. This lazy download will not work from outside the Microchip network. Download the build-env-.docker.gz Docker image from here Extract and load the image into your Docker daemon: $ gunzip -c build-env-.docker.gz | docker load At this point, the Docker image should be imported and ready to use by the dr command. With the Docker image in place, we can download the binary packet, extract it, and enter the folder containing the files: $ tar -xzf velocitydrivesp-lan969x-bin-.tar.gz $ cd velocitydrivesp-lan969x-bin- Test that the dr command is working and that the Docker image has been loaded correctly: $ dr ls -lagG total 408 drwxr-xr-x 10 340 Mar 11 15:29 . drwxrwxrwt 3 60 Mar 11 15:29 .. drwxr-xr-x 4 100 Mar 11 14:49 build-lan969x drwxr-xr-x 2 60 Mar 11 14:45 .cmake -rw-r--r-- 1 1450 Mar 11 14:45 CMakeLists.txt -rw-r--r-- 1 969 Mar 11 14:45 CMakePresets.json -rw-r--r-- 1 1016 Mar 11 14:45 .deps.json -rw-r--r-- 1 64 Mar 11 15:29 .docker-container-id -rw-r--r-- 1 1271 Mar 11 14:45 .docker.env drwxr-xr-x 3 60 Mar 11 14:45 docs drwxr-xr-x 4 80 Mar 11 14:45 extmod drwxr-xr-x 6 120 Mar 11 14:45 support drwxr-xr-x 3 80 Mar 11 14:45 target drwxr-xr-x 3 60 Mar 11 14:45 third-party drwxr-xr-x 5 160 Mar 11 14:45 utils -rw-r--r-- 1 390994 Mar 11 14:46 .velocitysp-yang-mods-cache -rw-r--r-- 1 318 Mar 11 14:45 .version.yaml Build the firmware image files for the EVBs supported in the given packet: $ rm -rf build-lan969x $ dr cmake --workflow --preset lan969x Executing workflow step 1 of 2: configure preset \"lan969x\" Preset CMake variables: CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=\"RelWithDebInfo\" CMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE:FILEPATH=\"/tmp/velocitydrivesp-lan969x-bin-a40143b6b/target/lan969x/toolchainfile.cmake\" LM_PRESET:STRING=\"lan969x\" -- The C compiler identification is GNU 11.4.0 -- The ASM compiler identification is GNU -- Found assembler: /usr/bin/aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc -- Detecting C compiler ABI info -- Detecting C compiler ABI info - done -- Check for working C compiler: /usr/bin/aarch64-linux-gnu-gcc - skipped -- Detecting C compile features -- Detecting C compile features - done -- Target family: lan969x, Preset: lan969x -- Configuring done (0.2s) -- Generating done (0.0s) -- Build files have been written to: /tmp/velocitydrivesp-lan969x-bin-a40143b6b/build-lan969x Executing workflow step 2 of 2: build preset \"lan969x\" [14/22] lan969x_extmod_gen Generating module file from input: lan969x_extmod [19/22] Generating lan969x_EV89P81A.img, lan969x_EV89P81A.fip VDSP_BIN_LAN969x_no_cbor.bin 764kb (limit: 800kb/95%) lan969x_EV89P81A.cbor 1kb (limit: 16kb/9%) lan969x_EV89P81A-secure.fip 91kb (limit: 120kb/76%) lan969x_EV89P81A.fip 887kb (limit: 896kb/99%) [20/22] Generating lan969x_EV23X71A.img, lan969x_EV23X71A.fip VDSP_BIN_LAN969x_no_cbor.bin 764kb (limit: 800kb/95%) lan969x_EV23X71A.cbor 1kb (limit: 16kb/11%) lan969x_EV23X71A-secure.fip 91kb (limit: 120kb/76%) lan969x_EV23X71A.fip 887kb (limit: 896kb/99%) [21/22] Generating lan969x_EV09P11A_AUTO.img, lan969x_EV09P11A_AUTO.fip VDSP_BIN_LAN969x_AUTO_no_cbor.bin 764kb (limit: 800kb/95%) lan969x_EV09P11A_auto.cbor 1kb (limit: 16kb/7%) lan969x_EV09P11A_AUTO-secure.fip 91kb (limit: 120kb/76%) lan969x_EV09P11A_AUTO.fip 887kb (limit: 896kb/99%) [22/22] Generating lan969x_EV89P81A_AUTO.img, lan969x_EV89P81A_AUTO.fip VDSP_BIN_LAN969x_AUTO_no_cbor.bin 764kb (limit: 800kb/95%) lan969x_EV89P81A_auto.cbor 1kb (limit: 16kb/9%) lan969x_EV89P81A_AUTO-secure.fip 91kb (limit: 120kb/76%) lan969x_EV89P81A_AUTO.fip 887kb (limit: 896kb/99%) $ See the generated output files: $ ls -1 build-lan969x/target/lan969x/*.img build-lan969x/target/lan969x/lan969x_EV09P11A_AUTO.img build-lan969x/target/lan969x/lan969x_EV23X71A.img build-lan969x/target/lan969x/lan969x_EV89P81A_AUTO.img build-lan969x/target/lan969x/lan969x_EV89P81A.img Adding a new board is a matter of creating a configuration file describing the board, and then adding a build target compiling this configuration file. The recommended way to do this is to copy the configuration file from one of the EVBs (the one being most similar) and then edit it to reflect the changes from the EVB to the custom board. cp target/lan969x/board-config/lan9698TSN-ev89p81a.yaml \\ target/lan969x/board-config/lan9698TSN-custom.yaml Add the board in target/lan969x/CMakeLists.txt by doing the following: Add another call of the lm_board_config_to_cbor macro to convert the YAML file (the one we just copied) to CBOR. Add another call of the LAN969X_IMAGE macro to combine the executable and the CBOR file from above, and generate image files. In this step, VelocityDRIVE-SP variant is also selected.

But to build a functional switch, the SoC needs to be mounted on a board, and when this board is designed, certain decisions are made. This includes: Port map and configuration What ports are used, what PHYs and what speeds Physical port numbers vs serdes/rgmii numbering etc. GPIO mappings Board reset, status LED, etc. Factory default configuration Example: if the box has a label saying the default IP is 10.0.0.1, then this configuration needs to go into the factory defaults. As the SW is designed to support a SoC, not a board/box, some tailoring layer is needed where the decisions made when designing a given board (schematic) can be augmented into the generalized SoC SW. This is referred to as SW-tailoring and is covered in detail in this part of the documentation. VelocityDRIVE-SP is distributed as binaries, and all the tailoring options described here can be used on the binary packets of VelocityDRIVE-SP. The mechanisms described here are the same as what Microchip uses to support their own EVBs, and the EVB tailoring is included in the binary packets as a reference example. The board tailoring features can be boiled down to the following categories: Board-config: also referred to as the Board-YANG because we use a YANG module to guard the schema on what can be put into the board-config. This file includes all the information from the schematic of the boards, which the SW needs to know about to be able to adjust its behavior on a given board. Factory defaults: This is the configuration applied if no user configuration has been saved on the board, or if a board is being reset to factory defaults. The factory defaults are stored in the board-config file along with the other settings. EXTMOD: This is specific functionality which optionally can be provided by the customer. The extmod is stored in the board-config file along with the other settings. Secure Boot: This is about signing the artifacts with keys controlled by the customer. To understand how the SW Tailoring is working, it is a good idea to look at the build process, which show how artifacts are generated and what are the inputs, outputs and dependencies. extmod is a load-able C library capable of letting the customer implement certain function to extend or tailor the behavioral of the binary SW packet. extmod is an optional component and if not needed, it can be skipped entirely. Build-wise, this is the first step as it has no dependencies. The input here is the C sources, which are compiled and linked using the GCC tool-chain to generate a ELF file. The ELF file is then processed by a script which take care of extracting only the object-code, and extract information on what region needs to be executable (the code) and what needs to to be RW (initialized data and BSS) These steps are illustrated below: In the end a \"extmod\" file is generated, which contain the text and region information. This file will be used as input in the next step. The board configuration, a CBOR encoded data structure including all the tailoring configuration, data and code. The docs/sw_refs/yang/board.yang file in the binary packet, provide the YANG schema documenting the individual fields. The board configuration contains the following major sections: board:drivers This list all the driver which needs to be instantiated at boot, and provide the needed parameters. This section conceptually similar to device trees. board:capabilities This is used to enable/disable certain features, and to control the scale and resource consumption for a given resource. board:factory_default_config This is the configuration to apply when the board is reset to factory defaults. board:extmod This is the loadable C library from previous section. When creating the board CBOR file the following input is needed: A YAML file containing the board:drivers, board:capabilities and board:factory_default_config. Optionally the extmod file from previous section. The YANG catalog with all the SID files. This is needed to convert all the string based identifier to ID. This YANG catalog is part of the binary packet. The bc2cbor will take these inputs, and generate the board.cbor file. This process is illustrated below: The resulting output is then used as input in the next step. The final step is the image generation. Here the board.cbor form the earlier step is appended to the binary, then it is signed for secure boot, and wrapped into a FIP image. This process is illustrated below: Beside form producing a FIP, an img file is also produced. The img file contains both the bootloader and the FIP provisioned in both FW partitions. This img file can be programmed directly into the flash. The resulting image is now ready for use.","title":"SW Tailoring","component":"vd-docs","version":"2025.03","name":"doc-tailor","url":"/vd-docs/2025.03/doc-tailor.html","titles":[{"text":"1.

It is documented in RFC TBD - 'CoAP Management Interface (CORECONF)'. CORECONF uses CoAP/UDP as a transport protocol and CBOR as a payload format RFC 8949. The connection to the CoAP server can either be made via MUP1 or IP and with or without DTLS (See Securing CoAP for additional details). VelocityDRIVE-SP uses a datastore model similar to the NMDA model as defined in REF-RFC8342 - 'Network Management Datastore Architecture (NMDA)' as shown in this drawing: It consists of four datastores: The datastore contains the current configuration of the device. This datastore is writable and accessed through the CoAP path /c via the CoAP methods PUT, DELETE, and iPATCH. The datastore contains the datastore and status data such as state and counters. This datastore is read-only and accessed through the CoAP path /c via the CoAP methods GET and FETCH. The datastore is stored persistently in non-volatile memory. It contains configuration data only and has the same structure as the datastore. It is accessed through the CoAP path /startup-config via the CoAP methods GET, PUT, and DELETE. The datastore is located in the flash image. It contains configuration data only and has the same structure as the datastore. The datastore cannot be accessed via CoAP and therefore has no CoAP path. It is stored in the flash image and can only be modified during a firmware update. If no datastore is present at boot time, is copied to during boot as shown in this drawing: CORECONF uses CBOR in all requests and responses. CBOR is a binary data serialization format that is loosely based on JSON and is defined in RFC 8949. CBOR is designed for use in constrained environments and the main design goals are: Small code size Small message size Support for conversion to and from JSON Extensibility without the need for version negotiation The length of each CBOR data item is normally encoded in the item itself. However, byte strings, text strings, arrays, and maps can be encoded with an indefinite length, using a \"break\" stop code to terminate the item. This is useful if a constrained device needs to start transmitting an item before the total length is known. The VelocityDRIVE-SP device understands both kinds of encoding but will normally encode arrays and maps as indefinite length items. CORECONF uses the YANG-to-CBOR mapping to encode request and response payloads, as documented in RFC 9254 - 'CBOR Encoding of Data Modeled with YANG'. CORECONF makes use of CBOR sequences in some of the request and response payloads. A CBOR sequence is simply a concatenation of independent CBOR items and is documented in RFC 8742 - 'Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) Sequences'. CBOR diagnostic notation is used in CBOR examples as it is readable unlike the binary CBOR format. Examples of CBOR Diagnostic Notation converted to CBOR HEX Notation using both implicit length and indefinite length notation: Diag Notation CBOR HEX Notation Remarks [ \"foo\", \"bar\" ] 82 # array(2) 63 # text(3) 666F6F # \"foo\" 63 # text(3) 626172 # \"bar\" Implicit length array of text strings [_ \"foo\", \"bar\" ] 9F # array(*) 63 # text(3) 666F6F # \"foo\" 63 # text(3) 626172 # \"bar\" FF # primitive(*) Indefinite length array of text strings. Note the use of '[_' instead of '[' and the FF primitive at the end. { 1: 42, 2: \"foo\" } A2 # map(2) 01 # unsigned(1) 18 2A # unsigned(42) 02 # unsigned(2) 63 # text(3) 666F6F # \"foo\" Implicit length map {_ 1: 42, 2: \"foo\" } BF # map(*) 01 # unsigned(1) 18 2A # unsigned(42) 02 # unsigned(2) 63 # text(3) 666F6F # \"foo\" FF # primitive(*) Indefinite length map. Note the use of '{_' instead of '{' and the FF primitive at the end. The examples above are created with this online tool. The Docker image contains the CBOR diagnostic utilities, which makes it possible to generate the same examples using the command line: $ dr 'echo \"[ \\\"foo\\\", \\\"bar\\\"]\" | diag2pretty.rb' 82 # array(2) 63 # text(3) 666f6f # \"foo\" 63 # text(3) 626172 # \"bar\" $ dr 'echo \"[_ \\\"foo\\\", \\\"bar\\\"]\" | diag2pretty.rb' 9f # array(*) 63 # text(3) 666f6f # \"foo\" 63 # text(3) 626172 # \"bar\" ff # primitive(*) $ dr 'echo \"{ 1:42, 2: \\\"foo\\\"}\" | diag2pretty.rb' bf # map(*) 01 # unsigned(1) 18 2a # unsigned(42) 02 # unsigned(2) 63 # text(3) 666f6f # \"foo\" ff # primitive(*) $ dr 'echo \"{_ 1:42, 2: \\\"foo\\\"}\" | diag2pretty.rb' a2 # map(2) 01 # unsigned(1) 18 2a # unsigned(42) 02 # unsigned(2) 63 # text(3) 666f6f # \"foo\" Use diag2cbor.rb to generate the binary CBOR and save it in a file for later use: $ dr 'echo \"[ \\\"foo\\\", \\\"bar\\\"]\" | diag2cbor.rb > tmp.cbor' Use cbor2diag.rb to show the content of the binary CBOR file: $ dr 'cat tmp.cbor | cbor2diag.rb' [\"foo\", \"bar\"] In order to be more compact, CORECONF uses globally unique identifiers instead of text strings, as used in the YANG specification. These identifiers are unsigned 63-bit integers and are called YANG Schema Item iDentifier or just SID. To ensure that SIDs are globally unique, the SIDs must be allocated via The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). The allocation process and other details like .sid file format are documented in RFC 9595 - 'YANG Schema Item iDentifier (YANG SID)' SIDs are allocated in ranges for each YANG module and the currently assigned ranges are documented in YANG SIDs. Note that some of the YANG modules used in VelocityDRIVE-SP have not yet been assigned an official range. It is, therefore, expected that the temporarily assigned SID ranges will change in the future. How to get the currently assigned SIDs for a specific firmware version of VelocityDRIVE-SP is explained here. When used as keys in a CBOR map, they are encoded using deltas, except for the outermost map: { 1000 : { // SID 1000 1 : 100, // SID 1001 20 : 101 // SID 1020 } } The currently assigned SIDs for a single .yang file are stored in the corresponding .sid file. The naming convention is as follows using ietf-interfaces.yang as an example: ietf-interfaces.yang -> ietf-interfaces@2018-02-20.sid The date part of the .sid filename corresponds to the newest revision found in the .yang file. Example of how to create an initial .sid file for ietf-interfaces.yang using entry point 1500 and size 100: dr pyang --sid-generate-file 1500:100 ietf-interfaces.yang This will generate the .sid file ietf-interfaces@2018-02-20.sid, where SIDs are numbered from 1500 and up. If ietf-interfaces.yang is modified and the revision is changed to e.g. 2025-01-01, then the .sid file must be updated without modifying the existing SID values. Example of how to update a .sid file when ietf-interfaces.yang has been modified: dr pyang --sid-update-file ietf-interfaces@2018-02-20.sid ietf-interfaces.yang Note that the existing .sid file is used as input. This will generate a new .sid file ietf-interfaces@2025-01-01.sid, where the previous SID values have been retained and the new SID values have been added. When working with SIDs it is important to know the relationship between the SIDs and the corresponding YANG paths. Each and every VelocityDRIVE-SP software release has a corresponding YANG catalog, which is a compressed file in tar.gz format that contains all relevant .yang and .sid files. The filename is the checksum of the content followed by '.tar.gz', e.g.: 4e600dde441af320f35d89194ffd99fc.tar.gz These YANG catalogs are stored at Microchips Open Source distribution on Amazon AWS and can be downloaded freely by anyone. For instructions on how to read the checksum used in the filename, see here. CORECONF uses three different variants of CBOR encoding in the CoAP payload. Each variant is defined as a CoAP Content Type (string) and an ID (numeric range 0-65535): Content Type ID CoAP Method Reference application/yang-data+cbor; id=sid 140 GET, PUT RFC 9254 application/yang-identifiers+cbor-seq 141 FETCH RFC TBD application/yang-instances+cbor-seq 142 POST, iPATCH RFC TBD Note that ID 141 and 142 have not yet been officially assigned by IANA and might change in the future. All currently defined CoAP Content-Formats are listed here. The content is a CBOR map, mapping SIDs into instance values: { 1000 : { // SID 1000 1 : 100, // SID 1001 20 : 101 // SID 1020 }, 2000 : { // SID 2000 1 : \"foo\", // SID 2001 20 : \"bar\" // SID 2020 22 : 42 // SID 2022 } } The content is a CBOR sequence of instance-identifiers: 1000, // Item one: SID 1000 [2000, \"foo\", \"bar\"] // Item two: SID 2000 with YANG keys \"foo\" and \"bar\" The content is a CBOR sequence, where each item is a CBOR map carrying an instance-identifier and its associated instance-value: { 1000 : 200 // Item one: SID 1000 }, { [2000, \"foo\", \"bar\"] : null // Item two: SID 2000 with keys \"foo\" and \"bar\" }, { 2000 : { // Item three: SID 2000 1 : \"foo\", // YANG key SID 2001 20 : \"bar\", // YANG key SID 2020 22 : 84 // YANG leaf SID 2022 } } The CoAP methods supported by CORECONF are: CoAP method CoAP request Content ID CoAP response Content ID Description GET n/a 140 Retrieve the datastore resource POST 142 142 Invoke an RPC or action PUT 140 n/a Create or replace a datastore resource DELETE n/a n/a Delete a datastore resource FETCH 141 142 Retrieve specific data nodes within a datastore resource iPATCH 142 n/a Create, replace and delete data node(s) within a datastore resource Event streams (notifications) are not currently supported.

The purpose of MUP1 is to offer a point-to-point interface which can work without any configuration, and which cannot be \"broken\" by applying configuration. It does have some similarities with SLIP (RFC1055), but as SLIP is IP based, it typically needs IP configuration on both server and client, which contradicts the purpose. In VelocityDRIVE-SP, MUP1 replaces the typical serial human-friendly console interface seen on many switches. MUP1 is a machine interface that, among other things, can carry CoAP frames, which then gives access to the entire management interface. To use the MUP1 interface, it is therefore required to have a client with MUP1 support. The purpose of this document is to specify the MUP1 protocol such that customers and/or third parties can implement MUP1 support in their client products. The MUP1 protocol is designed to meet the following goals: Low overhead, frame-based protocol. Integrity checking by using checksum. Access to CoAP stack, with security mechanisms offered by CoAP (DTLS). CoAP access will give access to all CoAP resources including the entire CORECONF interface. Point-to-point communication without any initial configuration. Not limited to CoAP, but shall also support other protocols. Both client and server can initiate messages. MUP1 is considered a layer-1 / transport-layer protocol, and is therefore not involved in stuff like security, reliability, and re-transmission. All of this is left for the higher layers.

It is designed to model configuration and state data manipulated by the Network Configuration Protocol (NETCONF), as well as other network management protocols such as RESTCONF Protocol and CoAP Management Interface (CORECONF). YANG provides a standardized way to model the operational and configuration data of network devices, enabling more efficient and consistent network management. The primary purpose of YANG is to provide a formalized language for defining the structure of network data. This includes configuration data, state data, Remote Procedure Calls (RPCs), and notifications. By using YANG, network operators and developers can create data models that are both human-readable and machine-processable, facilitating automation and reducing the potential for errors in network management. Hierarchical Data Modeling: YANG models data in a tree structure, which mirrors the hierarchical nature of network configurations. This makes it intuitive to represent complex configurations and relationships between different network elements. Extensibility: YANG supports the definition of modules, allowing for modular and reusable data models. Modules can even augment data into other modules. This extensibility ensures that YANG can adapt to evolving network technologies and requirements. Data Types and Constraints: YANG provides a rich set of built-in data types, such as integers, strings, and enumerations, as well as the ability to define custom types. It also supports constraints like range limits and pattern matching, ensuring data validity and consistency. RPCs and Notifications: YANG allows the definition of RPCs for executing operations on network devices and notifications for asynchronous event reporting. This capability is crucial for dynamic and real-time network management. Interoperability: YANG is designed to work seamlessly with NETCONF, a protocol for network configuration and management. However, it is also compatible with other protocols, such as CORECONF, making it versatile for various network management scenarios. A YANG module is a self-contained data model that defines a specific set of data and operations. Each module consists of several key components: Namespace: A unique identifier for the module, ensuring no conflicts with other modules. Prefix: A shorthand reference for the module, used within the module and by other modules that import it. Data Nodes: Elements that represent configuration and state data, organized hierarchically. Typedefs: Custom data types defined within the module. Groupings: Reusable sets of data nodes that can be included in multiple places within the module or other modules. RPCs and Notifications: Definitions for operations and event reporting. Consistency: YANG provides a standardized way to model network data, ensuring consistency across different devices and vendors. Automation: The machine-readable nature of YANG models facilitates automation in network configuration and management, reducing manual intervention and the risk of human error. Interoperability: By adhering to a common modeling language, YANG promotes interoperability between different network management tools and devices. Scalability: The modular and extensible design of YANG allows it to scale with the growing complexity of modern networks. In conclusion, YANG (RFC 7950) is a powerful and versatile data modeling language that plays a crucial role in modern network management. Its ability to provide a standardized, extensible, and interoperable framework for modeling network data makes it an essential tool for network operators and developers aiming to achieve efficient and reliable network operations. A YANG file uses the filename extension .yang. YANG deviations are a mechanism in the YANG data modeling language that allows a module to specify modifications to the definitions in another YANG module. This is particularly useful when a device or implementation does not fully comply with the standard definitions provided in a base YANG module. Deviations enable vendors or network operators to document and manage these differences in a standardized way. Key aspects of YANG deviations include: Deviation Statement: This is used within a YANG module to indicate that it is deviating from another module. The deviation statement specifies the target module and the specific nodes within that module that are being altered. Deviation Types: Common types of deviations include: Not-supported: Indicates that a particular node defined in the base module is not supported by the implementation. Add: Adds new constraints or properties to an existing node. Replace: Replaces existing properties or constraints of a node with new ones. Delete: Removes certain properties or constraints from a node. Use Cases: Deviations are used in scenarios where: A device does not support certain features or capabilities defined in a standard YANG module. A vendor needs to extend or modify standard YANG models to fit their specific implementation. Customizations are required for specific deployments or operational environments. Documentation and Management: By using deviations, vendors and network operators can clearly document the differences between their implementation and the standard YANG models. This helps in maintaining consistency, understanding the capabilities and limitations of devices, and ensuring interoperability. An example of a deviation might look like this: deviation /example-module:container/example-leaf { deviate not-supported; } In this example, the deviation indicates that the example-leaf node within the example-module is not supported by the implementation. Overall, YANG deviations provide a structured way to handle variations and ensure that these differences are well-documented and managed within the network management ecosystem. Deviation files in VelocityDRIVE-SP follow the following conventions: One deviation file per YANG file. In VelocityDRIVE-SP, the deviation filename is constructed by adding -dev after the basename. I.e. the deviation filename for example-interfaces.yang becomes example-interfaces-dev.yang. A YANG tree is a hierarchical representation of the data model defined by a YANG module. It visually depicts the structure of the data, including the organization of containers, lists, leaf nodes, and other elements. This tree structure helps users understand the relationships and dependencies between different parts of the data model. The YANG tree is defined in RFC 8340 - 'YANG Tree Diagrams'. Key components of a YANG tree include: Root Node: The top-level node of the tree, which typically represents the module itself or a top-level container within the module. Containers: These are organizational nodes that can group related data nodes together. Containers can contain other containers, lists, leaf nodes, and other elements. Lists: These are ordered collections of entries, where each entry is a complex type that can contain multiple data nodes. Lists are used to represent repeating elements, such as interfaces or routes. Leaf Nodes: These are the actual data elements that hold values. Leaf nodes are the endpoints of the tree and do not contain other nodes. They can be of various data types, such as integers, strings, or booleans. Leaf-Lists: These are similar to lists but contain simple data types rather than complex structures. A leaf-list is an unordered collection of leaf nodes. Choices and Cases: These are used to define conditional structures within the data model. A choice node represents a decision point, and each case node represents a possible option. Augmentations: These allow additional nodes to be added to an existing data model, extending its structure. Here’s an example of a simple YANG tree for a module that models network interfaces: module: example-interfaces +--rw interfaces +--rw interface* [name] +--rw name string +--rw description? string +--rw type identityref +--rw enabled? boolean +--ro oper-status enumeration +--ro last-change? yang:date-and-time In this example: The root node is the example-interfaces module. The interfaces container groups all interface-related data. The interface list represents multiple interface entries, each identified by a name. Each interface entry contains several leaf nodes, such as name, description, type, enabled, oper-status, and last-change. Configuration data nodes are prefixed with rw (read-write) and status/state data nodes are prefixed with ro (read-only). The full description of the node representation can be found here. The YANG tree provides a clear and organized way to visualize the structure of the data model, making it easier for developers and network operators to understand and work with the data. A YANG tree file uses the filename extension .tree and shows the resulting tree after any deviations have been applied. A YANG SID (Schema Item Identifier) file is a JSON-formatted file that maps YANG schema nodes to unique numeric identifiers called SIDs. These identifiers are used in protocols like CoAP (Constrained Application Protocol) and CBOR (Concise Binary Object Representation) to efficiently represent YANG data models in constrained environments. The YANG SIDs are defined in RFC 9595 - 'YANG Schema Item iDentifier (YANG SID)'. Key aspects of a YANG SID file include: SID Allocation: Each YANG schema node (e.g., modules, containers, lists, leafs) is assigned a unique SID. This helps in reducing the size of the data representation by using numeric identifiers instead of long textual names. As many of the YANG modules we use in VelocityDRIVE-SP have not yet been assigned a permanent SID range, the current allocations are expected to change going forward. JSON Structure: The SID file is structured in JSON format, making it easy to parse and use in various applications. The file typically includes mappings for all nodes in a YANG module. Fields in a SID File: assignment-ranges: Starting point and number of allocated SIDs for this module. module-name: The name of the YANG module. module-revision: The revision date of the YANG module. items: An array of objects, each representing a schema node with its corresponding SID. Example: Here is an example of a YANG SID file corresponding to the YANG tree in the previous section: { \"assignment-ranges\": [ { \"entry-point\": 1000, \"size\": 50 } ], \"module-name\": \"example-interfaces\", \"module-revision\": \"2025-01-01\", \"items\": [ { \"namespace\": \"module\", \"identifier\": \"example-interfaces\", \"status\": \"unstable\", \"sid\": 1000 }, { \"namespace\": \"data\", \"identifier\": \"/example-interfaces:interfaces\", \"status\": \"unstable\", \"sid\": 1005 }, { \"namespace\": \"data\", \"identifier\": \"/example-interfaces:interfaces/interface\", \"status\": \"unstable\", \"sid\": 1006 }, { \"namespace\": \"data\", \"identifier\": \"/example-interfaces:interfaces/interface/description\", \"status\": \"unstable\", \"sid\": 1007 }, { \"namespace\": \"data\", \"identifier\": \"/example-interfaces:interfaces/interface/enabled\", \"status\": \"unstable\", \"sid\": 1008 }, { \"namespace\": \"data\", \"identifier\": \"/example-interfaces:interfaces/interface/last-change\", \"status\": \"unstable\", \"sid\": 1009 }, { \"namespace\": \"data\", \"identifier\": \"/example-interfaces:interfaces/interface/name\", \"status\": \"unstable\", \"sid\": 1010 }, { \"namespace\": \"data\", \"identifier\": \"/example-interfaces:interfaces/interface/oper-status\", \"status\": \"unstable\", \"sid\": 1011 }, { \"namespace\": \"data\", \"identifier\": \"/example-interfaces:interfaces/interface/type\", \"status\": \"unstable\", \"sid\": 1012 } ] } In this example: - The `module-name` is \"example-interfaces\". - The `module-revision` is \"2025-01-01\". - The `items` array contains mappings of schema nodes to their SIDs. Usage: SIDs are used in constrained environments to optimize the encoding and transmission of YANG-modeled data. By using numeric identifiers, the data size is reduced, which is crucial for devices with limited resources. Management: SIDs are typically managed by a central authority or registry to ensure uniqueness and avoid conflicts. This ensures that each SID is globally unique and can be reliably used across different implementations and devices. In summary, a YANG SID file provides a compact and efficient way to represent YANG schema nodes using numeric identifiers, facilitating the use of YANG data models in resource-constrained environments. A YANG SID file uses the filename extension .sid and includes the module revision as part of the basename. The SID file name for example-interfaces.yang then becomes example-interfaces@2025-01-01.sid. The term \"YANG Catalog\" refers to a repository or database that contains YANG data models. See here for more information about \"YANG Catalog\" in VelocityDRIVE-SP. Although using payload encoded as binary CBOR is useful and necessary in a constrained environment, it is not especially user-friendly. It is possible to use CBOR Diagnostic Notation towards the user and let the client tool handle the conversion from CBOR Diagnostic Notation to binary CBOR and vice versa. This approach has the disadvantage that the user will need to know the numerical SIDs and must be mentally capable of connecting these numbers to a YANG model. To make it easier for the user, Microchip has developed a few CLI tools that enable the user to query and configure a VelocityDRIVE-SP device using JSON or YAML encoded data as payload: mvdct - CLI part of the VelocityDRIVE-CT package - supports JSON only mup1cc - part of this package - supports both JSON and YAML Both of these tools make use of the YANG Catalog in order to convert between JSON/YAML and CBOR. The connection between JSON and YANG is defined in RFC 7951 - 'JSON Encoding of Data Modeled with YANG', and because YAML is considered to be a superset of JSON, it is possible to use YAML as long as YAML is supported by the client tool. How to encode YANG data to CBOR is defined in RFC 9254 - 'Encoding of Data Modeled with YANG in the Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR)'. Note that this only covers the data syntax and not how requests and responses should look. See the Examples below on how to use YAML in requests and responses. Here is an example of using YAML versus CBOR Diagnostic Notation to specify a YANG instance identifier to get the type of interface \"1\" using a CoAP FETCH method. YAML request: - \"/ietf-interfaces:interfaces/interface[name='1']/type\" YAML response: --- - \"/ietf-interfaces:interfaces/interface/type\": iana-if-type:ethernetCsmacd CBOR Diagnostic Notation request: [_ 2061, \"1\"] CBOR Diagnostic Notation response: {_ 2061: 3088} It should be pretty obvious to see which of the formats that are most oriented towards the YANG model. These examples are intended to show how to create a valid YAML request for different CoAP methods, and not to explain what a specific request will do on a VelocityDRIVE-SP device. For information about the different features in a VelocityDRIVE-SP device, please see the Configuration Guides section. In YAML it is possible to break a string over multiple lines by ending a line with '\\' and continue on the next line. This is used in the examples to prevent the need for a horizontal scrollbar. The FETCH and iPATCH methods support multiple requests in a single method and this is why a request must always be specified as a YAML sequence (aka array), even if there is only a single request. A YAML sequence starts with a dash and space (\"- \"). The FETCH and iPATCH methods use instance identifiers as specified in RFC7951-6.11. All parent keys must be present in an instance identifier. The examples use YANG objects from ieee802-dot1q-bridge.tree and ietf-interfaces.tree A FETCH request consists of an instance identifier that includes all parent keys. FETCH request of a YANG list with two parent keys 'b0' and 'c0': - \"/ieee802-dot1q-bridge:bridges/bridge[name='b0']/component[name='c0']/\\ filtering-database/vlan-registration-entry\" FETCH response: --- - \"/ieee802-dot1q-bridge:bridges/bridge/component/filtering-database/\\ vlan-registration-entry\": - database-id: 0 vids: '1' entry-type: static port-map: - port-ref: 1 static-vlan-registration-entries: vlan-transmitted: untagged - port-ref: 2 static-vlan-registration-entries: vlan-transmitted: tagged - database-id: 0 vids: '10' entry-type: static port-map: - port-ref: 3 static-vlan-registration-entries: vlan-transmitted: untagged - port-ref: 4 static-vlan-registration-entries: vlan-transmitted: tagged Note that the response consists of a sequence of two entries. When fetching a list without including the list’s own keys, a sequence of all entries is returned. FETCH request of YANG list as above, but now also including the list’s own keys: - \"/ieee802-dot1q-bridge:bridges/bridge[name='b0']/component[name='c0']/\\ filtering-database/vlan-registration-entry[database-id='0'][vids='1']\" FETCH response: --- - \"/ieee802-dot1q-bridge:bridges/bridge/component/filtering-database/\\ vlan-registration-entry\": database-id: 0 vids: '1' entry-type: static port-map: - port-ref: 1 static-vlan-registration-entries: vlan-transmitted: untagged - port-ref: 2 static-vlan-registration-entries: vlan-transmitted: tagged Note that the response consists of a single entry. When fetching a list and including the list’s own keys, only a single entry is returned. An iPATCH request consists of an instance identifier that includes all parent keys and a value. We use complex keys in all examples as we think they are more readable. A complex key is preceded by a question mark and space (\"? \") and the corresponding value is defined on the next line and preceded by a colon and space (\": \"). Example of a YAML object using a complex key: - ? \"key\" : \"value\" The YANG object, specified by the instance identifier, is deleted if the value is empty or null. Deleting is supported on containers and lists but not on leaves and leaf-lists. iPATCH request for deleting a specific entry in a YANG list: - ? \"/ieee802-dot1q-bridge:bridges/bridge[name='b0']/component[name='c0']/\\ filtering-database/vlan-registration-entry[database-id='0'][vids='1']\" : Note that the list’s own keys are specified in the instance identifier. The only place where the list’s own keys are allowed in the instance identifier is in a delete operation like this. Also note that the value is empty. iPATCH request for deleting all entries in a YANG list: - ? \"/ieee802-dot1q-bridge:bridges/bridge[name='b0']/component[name='c0']/\\ filtering-database/vlan-registration-entry\" : Note that none of the list’s own keys are specified in the instance identifier. iPATCH request for deleting a YANG container: - ? \"/ieee802-dot1q-bridge:bridges/bridge[name='b0']/component[name='c0']/\\ filtering-database\" : Note that in most circumstances it makes no sense to delete a container, as it will only be reset to a system-defined default content. iPATCH request for creating a vlan-registration-entry: - ? \"/ieee802-dot1q-bridge:bridges/bridge[name='b0']/component[name='c0']/\\ filtering-database/vlan-registration-entry\" : database-id: 0 vids: '1' entry-type: static port-map: - port-ref: 1 static-vlan-registration-entries: vlan-transmitted: untagged - port-ref: 2 static-vlan-registration-entries: vlan-transmitted: tagged Note that none of the list’s own keys must be specified in the instance identifier. Also note that the value is a YAML map which corresponds to a YANG container. When a container is added to a list, only the container is added (or replaced). Previous entries in the list are left as they were before the iPATCH operation. iPATCH request for creating a vlan-registration-entry: - ? \"/ieee802-dot1q-bridge:bridges/bridge[name='b0']/component[name='c0']/\\ filtering-database/vlan-registration-entry\" : - database-id: 0 vids: '10' entry-type: static port-map: - port-ref: 3 static-vlan-registration-entries: vlan-transmitted: untagged - port-ref: 4 static-vlan-registration-entries: vlan-transmitted: tagged - database-id: 0 vids: '11' entry-type: static port-map: - port-ref: 1 static-vlan-registration-entries: vlan-transmitted: untagged - port-ref: 2 static-vlan-registration-entries: vlan-transmitted: tagged Note that none of the list’s own keys must be specified in the instance identifier. Also note that the value is a YAML sequence (aka array), which corresponds to a YANG list. When a list is added to a list, the original list is replaced with the new list. Previous entries in the list are now gone. iPATCH request for setting a single leaf, vlan-transmitted, to tagged: - ? \"/ieee802-dot1q-bridge:bridges/bridge[name='b0']/component[name='c0']/\\ filtering-database/vlan-registration-entry[database-id='0'][vids='1']/\\ port-map[port-ref='1']/static-vlan-registration-entries/vlan-transmitted\" : tagged Note that all parent keys must be specified in the instance identifier.","title":"Technology: YANG","component":"vd-docs","version":"2025.03","name":"doc-tech-yang","url":"/vd-docs/2025.03/doc-tech-yang.html","titles":[{"text":"1.
